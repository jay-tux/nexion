## The Forgotten World
### Invasion
Back on the Forgotten World, life was easy. Lush vegetation and friendly creatures surrounded peaceful settlements. Travel was safe, and all prospered. Exploration was not quite important, and thus, only a part of the continent Anima, where they lived, was known.

But everything changed when the Invasion began. At first, they were minor raids. Annoying but not threatening. However, as soon as those raiding scouts noticed that defenses were minimal on Anima, those raids became larger, full scale attacks, until at last, the bulk of the army arrived.

It was a massacre. Towns were destroyed, people were killed, houses were burned. The Oppressor had arrived, and with it, the wings of darkness settled in everyone's mind.

### Oppressor
The Oppressor, humanoids with sharp, slanted ears and an unmatched desire for murder and slavery. They came from the South, killing every hope of freedom the peoples of Anima once had. They were smart, but vain. They were beautiful, but ruthless. They knew no mercy. They were elves.

### Riots
However, freedom is something that can't really be taken away. The people of Anima learned to arm themselves. They trained and met in secret. They started raiding the Oppressor's carts and caravans, until soon, people were rioting daily and in plain sight. Burning the houses of rich Oppressors, destroying the bridges built by slavery, lynching officers and officials.

However, the Oppressor struck back. Merciless assaults where only the weak survived. Anima's peoples were shocked by such destruction. They had nothing left, their people taken away to the salt-mines of the South.

### Slavery
And such, the miserable people of Anima were kept in caves, inhumane prisons for slaves. They had to share their "homes" with animals of all kinds and were often beaten and whipped for the pleasure of the Oppressor. They had to work in mines and quarries, always given just enough food not to outright starve. Their minds were dulled by a kind of drug the Oppressor put in the little food they were given. Anima's peoples, once proud and lively, were only a shadow of themselves.

Two races managed to escape this terrible fate: the Orcs were driven back to hiding and kept fighting the Oppressor whenever possible, using their superior strength to defend themselves and their lesser intelligence to ward of the effects of elven magic. The Halflings on the other hand, were forced to be jesters and entertainers for rich Oppressors, often performing dangerous acts against their will.

## The Journey
### Ejection
After centuries of slavery, the most improbable event happened. One night, after the slaves' cave was completely locked off, a meteor struck right next to it. The magical field which prevented anything from escaping kept the whole cave, and a lot of surrounding earth, in one piece. The impact of the meteor, however, sent the cave flying, off the face of the Forgotten World, and into space.

### Voyage
For thousands and thousands of years, the huge cave flew through space, protected by its magical field. Nothing could go out, nothing could get in. The people inside learned to rely on each other. Luckily, the cave was very large, allowing for a nice micro-climate and even some fungi-like plants. Some of the plants even made sure there was a lot of light for the ex-enslaved.

## Nexion
### Arrival
After thousands upon thousands of years of travel, the cave finally encountered another planet, Nexion. Crashing through the air proved too much for the magical field, which was dispersed by the crash. Out came the people of Anima, ready for a second shot at existence.

This time, they vowed, this time they wouldn't let themselves be enslaved again.

### Liberty
After arriving on Nexion, Anima's peoples came out and explored the surrounding plains, later named the ![arrival]. Encountering not a single Oppressor, happiness struck all hearts. After some more exploration, they set out to found a city. This (mythical) city was called Anima, after the continent of their ancestors. However, it was soon struck by disaster and the survivors fled south, founding the once great city of Liberty, celebrating their refound freedom. What happened to Anima is unknown, but none have ever seen its ruins.

### Natives
The settlers of Liberty soon encountered the bugbears of Nexion. Afraid of what they'd never seen before, they struck out and started pillaging any bugbear camps they could find. The kobolds soon met the same fate, getting decimated.

After a while, the peoples of Anima realized what they'd done; they'd become Oppressors of their own. They retreated to Liberty and carefully sent out emissaries bearing gifts and bringing peace again.

### Exploration
After atoning for their offenses, Anima's peoples started exploring this exciting world of Nexion, settling where they felt most at home. However, not all of Nexion is known yet.
