# Nexion - Religions and Factions
*This document aims to list the available religions a player can choose for their character. Of the factions, only the Pioneer's Delight is known to the players (as they're a member); of course a DM can appoint one (or more) players as spies or hidden operatives of another organization. The other factions listed are political organizations.*

## Religions
Each major religion on Nexion has its own aspects on an individual's life. Deceased followers of a religion face the afterlife granted by their deity (or oblivion, depending on their lifestyle).

### Bara-Api
![bara] Bara-Api is the maned god of fire and war, but also of emotions. Bara-Api's followers are fierce combatants, but they also appreciate passion in other aspects of their life.

Altars dedicated to Bara-Api are usually stone tablets (often round) with a hole for a campfire in the middle. Offerings are burnt, after which the spirit of the offering is said to pass on to the Great Bonfire hereafter.

The passion which burns in your veins can ignite others, granting you a +1 bonus to your Charisma. However, it also makes you quick to jump to conclusions, decreasing your Wisdom by 1. Additionally, other followers of the Flamelord will always grant you a place at their hearth.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | CHA +1
 Drop | WIS -1
 Non-combat | Hospitality from other followers.

### Degat
![degat] Degat is the aquatic goddess of water and the seas, but also of childbirth. Degat's followers tend to be thoughtful but they can get vicious when threatened.

Degat's shrines are usually built from shells and coral. Most are located in water or close to it. Offerings to Degat tend to be soluble or washable, such that there's always place for more offerings. For her followers, the Palace Deep Under is nirvana.

The cool intelligence that comes with deciphering Degat's cryptic messages made you brighter than most, granting you a +1 boost to your Intelligence. However, it also left you a bit stiff, decreasing your Dexterity by 1. Additionally, you have access to the *Read the Streams* ability.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | INT +1
 Drop | DEX -1
 Non-combat | *Read the Streams*.

***Read the Streams:*** While traveling or when making a calculated choice, you can ask for Degat's guidance. This can only be done when you're near a large body of water (a large lake, the sea, ...) or body of running water (a small river, but not a small stream). To do so, make an Intelligence (INT) check and subtract the amount of times you've been granted guidance already during the last four days (INT - amount of successes). If you succeed, you will receive a cryptic hint as to which is (according to Degat) the right thing to do.

### Eluygh
![elu] Eluygh is the winged goddess of heaven and healing, but also of ice. Eluygh's followers are usually wise people, but very set in their minds.

Eluygh doesn't have any dedicated altars. Anything that's deliberately thrown down into a ravine counts as a sacrifice, as well as anything left on mountain tops. Eluygh's Domain is said to be a rough but hospitable mountain range.

The insight granted by the long-living angels who sometimes visit mortals made you very sage, granting a +1 boost to your Wisdom. However, Eluygh's teachings are painstakingly rigorous, making you a bit inflexible and decreasing your Dexterity by 1. Additionaly, an angel watches over you, preventing you from getting lost in the highlands.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | WIS +1
 Drop | DEX -1
 Non-combat | Not getting lost.

### Ghry-An
![ghry] Ghry-An is the radiant god of the sun and prosperity, but also of adventure. Ghry-An's followers are usually strong and resilient, but they are usually a bit naive.

Ghry-An doesn't require sacrifices. Anything that lives under his shine is protected and loved by him. However, those that turn to darkness and the night never climb the Soul-Rainbow to reach the Sun itself.

Your resilience manifests in a +1 boost to your Strength. However, most explorers are short-lived, and aren't quite quick-witted, decreasing your Intelligence by 1. During the day, you can see everything as if it were brightly lit. However, this doesn't disperse magical darkness.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | STR +1
 Drop | INT -1
 Non-combat | "Full" *Darkvision* during the day.

### Itanatan
![itan] Itanatan is the armored god of honor and pride, but also of strength. Itanatan's followers tend to be thorough, but a bit blunt at times.

Itanatan's altars resemble long, carefully decorated, stone desks. Papers are pile on top of them during the week, and on the eighth day of each week, they're burnt. This makes the words permanent, and Itanatan, who dwells in the Fort of Justice, will punish those who break agreements mercilessly.

Due to the training of your ancestors, and your god's blessing, your Wisdom gets a +1 boost. However, your traditional bluntness decreases your Charisma by 1. Additionally, you can always find another follower who'll gladly explain the local government and its rules.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | STR +1
 Drop | CHA -1
 Non-combat | Legal help anywhere.

### Khash
![khash] Khash is the faceless goddess of silence and stealth, but also of flight. Khash's followers tend to be silent and attentive, albeit a bit unfit.

Altars to Khash are always in silent rooms, with empty rooms around them. Offerings are placed carefully onto the altar and disappear when unwatched. Each of the offerings is brought to The Gargantuan Library by her invisible messengers.

Due to your attentiveness, you know much more than most, granting you a +1 boost on your Wisdom. However, you're also quite unfit, decreasing your Strength by 1. Additionally, any librarian or other literary clerk will grant you entry to their respective collections.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | WIS +1
 Drop | STR -1
 Non-combat | Free library entrance.


### Lskr
![lskr] Lskr is the reptilian god of snakes and reptiles, but also of power. His followers tend to use their suppleness instead of brute force.

His altars tend to be made of wood, with burn marks forming disturbing (to non-initiates) patterns. Sacrifices of any animals and plants are dissolved in acid and their spirits are sent to the Great Southern Dens.

Owing to your hereditary boons and curses, your Dexterity gets a +1 boost while your Strength suffers a -1 decrease. Additionally, you're able to talk to reptiles and snakes.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | DEX +1
 Drop | STR -1
 Non-combat | Talk to reptiles.

### Uyul
![uyul] Uyul is the treefolk god of nature and mountains, but also of self-sufficiency. Uyul's followers are resilient but stubborn.

As the only god who wanders on Nexion, Uyul collects his own sacrifices. After his followers deliver the carefully prepared dishes to the beautifully carved wooden and ivory statues, Uyul himself comes to devour the meals. However, wandering Nexion implies that Uyul is permanently absent from his own home, The Cavernous Woods.

Part of your self-sufficiency manifests in your +1 boost to Dexterity, and your stubbornness is obvious through the decrease of 1 in your Intelligence. Additionally, you're used to a rough lifestyle, allowing you to ignore one level of exhaustion at all times and allowing you to recover one level of exhaustion during a short rest (can be used once per long rest).

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | DEX +1
 Drop | CHA -1
 Non-combat | Ignore exhaustion.

### Votthoboveigh
![vot] Votthoboveigh is the diamond goddess of miners and artifice, but also of trade. Her followers are smart but a bit senseless.

Each community of followers have their communal altar to the goddess. Altars are always shining with gems and precious metals, preferably imported. Sacrifices consist of crushed gemstones, powdered gold and broken tools. Those who enriched Votthoboveigh of them are allowed into the Golden Gardens after their demise.

Your sharpness grants you a +1 boost to Intelligence, but your senselessness manifests in a decrease of Wisdom by 1. Additionally, you have a keen sense for haggling and you're usually able to get discounts from other followers and non-believers alike.

 Summary | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Boost | INT +1
 Drop | WIS -1
 Non-combat | Haggling.

## Factions
### Pioneer's Delight
The Pioneer's Delight, your second home, is an organization of pioneers, explorers and heroes. With offices and building in every city, markets and warehouses along rivers and mountain ranges alike, the organization is prepared for everyone. New members are recruited from the young, but older starters are welcome as well. Pioneer's Delight is *the* organization for those wanting to live an active, outdoorsy life.

#### Structure
The guild is governed by the Grandmaster. Only the highest ranking officials have ever met the Grandmaster. Rumors go that he's lived for over 900 years, and that he's even founded some of the cities of Nexion. It's said that he never sleeps, always reading the newest reports arriving in his office.  
The Grandmaster is directly supported by his Planners, who are in charge of the daily governing of the guild. Additionally, the Grandmaster's direct orders are sent to the Branch Heads, each of which rules over one of the Pioneer's Delight's branches: one for almost every major area of Nexion, each in their "own" city (![h_ice] ([Arhusgh](./world_fow_cities.md#arhusgh)), ![v_heaven] ([Walchen](./world_fow_cities.md#walchen)), ![grandf] ([Navan](./world_fow_cities.md#navan)), ![des_ancients] ([Remicj](./world_fow_cities.md#remicj)), ![corn] ([Sanctuary](./world_fow_cities.md#sanctuary)), ![northern] ([Aurora](./world_fow_cities.md#aurora)), ![arrival] ([Liberty](./world_fow_cities.md#liberty)), ![frozen] ([Highcastle](./world_fow_cities.md#highcastle)), ![pine] ([Peinsheim](./world_fow_cities.md#peinsheim)), ![overgr] ([Xocali](./world_fow_cities.md#xocali)), ![lava] ([Obsidiana](./world_fow_cities.md#obsidiana)), ![storm_des] ([Ulthar](./world_fow_cities.md#ulthar)), ![anly] ([Castleport](./world_fow_cities.md#castleport)) and the Maritime Branch ([Libag](./world_fow_cities.md#seas-and-oceans))).  
Each of the Branch Heads then commands their Branches (where the ![gold] are ruled from Walchen and the ![free_h] from Sanctuary). The local offices, in turn, are ruled by an Overseer. Each of the local offices has some trainers, who help you get ready for the real world, some scouts and a few professional pioneers.

#### The Members
Each pioneer has trained for a long time, doing local, low-danger missions to become a professional pioneer. Those professionals are quickly recognized by their tattoo: the icon of the faction is tattooed onto both of their wrists. While they will usually aid each other, sometimes their ranks can cause friction: each pioneer of the same rank is an other's rival for promotion. Below are the ranks and their benefits (benefits are cumulative; each rank also has access to all benefits of a lower rank):
 - **Pio:** freshly 'graduated' and ready to go exploring, the Pios are the lowest rank. They usually get the safest missions. However, they do not form the bulk of the Pioneer's Delight. Most Pios either promote quickly or don't survive.
  - Can rely on Pioneer's Delight healers.
 - **Pathfinder:** a Pio is often promoted to a Pathfinder after a few missions. They form the bulk of the organization's members.
  - Can rely on Pioneer's Delight spy reports for information.
  - Can request help of Pios through higher-ranking officials.
 - **Trailblazer:** most Pathfinders get promoted after about 5 years of service. However, certain missions can help one rank up quicker. Exceptional deeds might cause a Branch Head to promote a Pathfinder immediately. Promotion to a Trailblazer always happens in a Branch Head's office.
  - Can recruit and train new trainees (most recruiters and trainers are Trailblazers).
  - Can enlist Pios for help.
  - Can file mission proposals.
  - Can request funding.
  - Can rely on safe houses.
 - **Wanderer:** every few years, a Trailblazer is promoted to be a Wanderer. For this huge honor, one must travel back to [Liberty](./world_fow_cities.md#liberty) for a ceremony. Very few Wanderers have been with the organization for less than 15 years. All Branch Heads are Wanderers or higher.
  - Can enlist any lower rank for help.
  - Can accept and deny mission proposals.
  - Has access to top-secret information reports.
  - Can grant funding.
 - **Voyager:** the bee's knees, Voyagers are extremely rare and powerful, often doing missions with world-shaking consequences. Only a few Voyagers are known, and most of them are legends. The Grandmaster himself is the most notable example of a Voyager.
  - Voyagers have almost unlimited power within the Pioneer's Delight.

Additionally, there are some ranks which are given to members after performing certain great feats:
 - **Explorer:** the first to explore and map an hitherto unknown area, Explorers were common in the early days.
  - Has ownership of a manor in the explored area. The manor is designed and built by the organization.
 - **Settler:** they've helped settle and protect the first cities in areas explored by the Explorers, Settlers are often founding fathers.
  - Has ownership of a manor, with personnel, close to the city or township. The manor is designed and built by the organization. This often comes with quite a lot of servants and peasants.
 - **Groundbreaker:** their inventions speak for themselves. Groundbreakers are geniuses beyond measure.
  - Is entitled a share of the profits on the sale of their inventions.
  - Is granted a laboratory for continued research.
 - **Instigator:** they have the brightest souls, capable of lighting others. Until now, no-one has ever been granted the Instigator title, so no-one really knows what it holds.
  - Unknown boons.

#### Specializations
*Specializations replace the standard D&D 5e backgrounds. Each one matches a ![PHb] background, except for the clothes: everyone starts in the simple Pioneer's Delight uniform.*  
As few people are jacks of all trades, most trainees choose their specialization early on. Here are some of the most common ones:

 ![PHb] background | Specialization
 --- | ---
 Acolyte | Disciple
 Charlatan | Trickster
 Entertainer | Gladiator
 Criminal | Shadow-dweller
 Folk Hero | Role Model
 Guild Artisan | Master
 Hermit | Lone Wolf
 Outlander | Trapper
 Sage | Savant
 Soldier | Militia
 Urchin | Lost One

### Northern Confederation
The Northern Confederation is a political union. It consists of a large group of town controlled by the ![hill] in the ![h_ice]. Only dwarves are allowed to have a seat in their ranks. The northern tundra makes sure the Confederation depends on itself for survival. Members always wear a heavy necklace with their rank on it in public. They also protect the quality and price of any outbound goods.

### Confederacy of Religious Interests
The Confederacy of Religious Interests (the *CRI*) used to be a strong and powerful union of cities and towns in the ![arrival], but it has fallen to ruin. Schisms and other fights caused splinter groups to tear from the *CRI*. The only place where they have any real power is in their seat: Prophethome.

### InterOperating Union
Originally a trader's deal, the InterOperating Union (the *IOU*)has grown to be a very powerful influence on the ![lava], controlling its largest city: Obsidiana. Outside of the ![lava], they also control most of the towns leading to the north, to Tyanhuar in the ![overgr]. To get their voices heard, the *IOU* uses both a strong military force and embargoes.

### Negosy
Where the InterOperating Union is trusted by its members, the Negosy are feared. The few, obscenely rich merchants control the ![anly] with iron fists and enormous armies.
