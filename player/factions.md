# Nexion - Religions and Factions
*This document aims to list the available religions a player can choose for their character. Of the factions, only the Pioneer's Delight is known to the players (as they're a member); of course a DM can appoint one (or more) players as spies or hidden operatives of another organization. The other factions listed are political organizations.*
