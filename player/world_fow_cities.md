## Holy Lands
### Arhusg ![h_ice]
The northernmost city on Nexion, Arhusg is home to a lot of miners and ice-miners. People usually arrive by crossing the frozen sea on sleds, which is a lot faster than the bumpy roads through the tundra. The *Northern Confederation*, a large group of towns and cities controlled by the hill dwarfs, has their main seat in Arhusg. There are rumors that there exists an equally big city underground.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,250 inhabitants
 Government | **Confederacy:** Arhusg is the seat of the *Northern Confederation*, a large group of towns controlled by the hill dwarfs.
 Majority | ![hill] (government officials, miners, ...)
 Minorities | ![blue] and ![kobold] (police force), ![rock] (traders and artificers)
 Crime rates | Very low: most dwarfs are lawful by nature, and the tundra makes sure the community relies on itself for sustenance.
 Religion | ![todo] (dwarven religion), but others are tolerated as well

### Feldkirch ![h_ice]
Originally founded as a dragonborn monastery, Feldkirch is now a large city around said monastery. The monks have extralegal rights and don't really have to adhere to laws; however, their grandmaster has enacted certain strict rules. One can approach Feldkirch's structure as an onion: the innermost layer has the monastery, the next contains some original inhabitants and artificers, the next has most of the wealthy traders and important people and the outermost layer is home to farmers and miners.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,250 inhabitants
 Government | **Confederacy:** Feldkirch falls under the *Northern Confederation*, however, the monastery doesn't and follows the rules of the grandmaster.
 Majority | ![hill] (miners, farmers, traders)
 Minorities | ![blue] and ![kobold] (monks), ![rock] (traders and artificers)
 Crime rates | No crime is reported from the monastery, low crime exists in the city.
 Religion | Most people adhere to the monks' point of view, however ![todo] (dwarven religion) is common as well

### Nakskov ![h_ice]
Nakskov is a mysterious city: all people who ever went there, didn't return (except in pieces). According to rogues who spied the surrounding tundra, the city seems to be inhabited by orcs alone. Nakskov looks, according to them, like a giant fortress with giant walls. As no-one has ever seen it inside, trade must be non-existent.

### Visby ![v_heaven]
Visby is a popular destination for goliath who aren't strong, athletic or smart enough; or any goliath that aren't naturally competitive. However, living close to the desert isn't really comfortable to them. Visby is also a safe haven for retired traders from the Desert of the Ancients and houses a surprising number of old, tired tabaxi as well. The city is planned in districts so each of the groups has their own space.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,500 inhabitants
 Government | **Republic/Democracy:** only the (original) dwarfs are allowed to vote.
 Majority | ![mountain] (original population; miners and traders)

 Crime rates | (Violent) clashes between the different groups of citizens are quite common
 Religion | Any and all religions are accepted and common in Visby

### Trakt ![v_heaven]
Trakt is rumored to be one of Nexion's most beautiful cities. However, most never go there as even staying a night involves many competitions with the goliath who rule the city. A lot of the people who do visit, were invited to stay with the dragonborn and/or mountain dwarfs.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,250 inhabitants
 Government | **Meritocracy:** the most competent goliath (the one who has won the most official competitions), rules Trakt (with the help of some others for the day-to-day decisions)
 Majority | ![goliath]
 Minorities | ![goldd] (elder, resident traders), ![mountain] (miners)
 Crime rates | Low to very low, goliath justice is swift and merciless
 Religion | ![todo] (goliath religion), most others are deemed unworthy

### Walchen ![v_heaven]
The city of Walchen is meant to keep scoundrels, criminals and fortune seekers from the Gold Shores away from the Veil of Heaven. The city is built on one side of the giant wall dividing the Veil of Heaven and the Gold Shores. In the middle of the city lies the gate through the wall, surrounded by the garrison's barracks. A small fishermen port supplies the garrison with food while some (respectable) traders have their homes in the city, which allows for easy trade down to the Gold Shores. Everyone coming from the Gold Shores is rigorously searched and checked.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~850 inhabitants
 Government | **Militocracy:** Walchen is built around the sole gate in the giant wall that divides the Gold Shores and the Veil of Heaven.

 Crime rates | Very low: the garrison keeps everyone in check

### Raphoe ![grandf]
Raphoe is a small city, by all measures. It has a low population, and the as most of the population (if not all), are halfling-sized, there aren't any human-sized homes. Most larger races tend to avoid Raphoe. It's a colony for Artrane on The Old World.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~850 inhabitants
 Government | **Satrapy:** Raphoe is the only actual colony left on Nexion. It's controlled by Artrane's government, but has a minimal local bureaucracy to take the day-to-day decisions.
 Majority | ![lightfoot] (mostly local farmers and officials)
 Minorities | ![stout] (artificers), ![hill] (miners), ![bugbear] (slaves)
 Crime rates | Low apart from the few bugbears who try to break free or steal to buy themselves free.
 Religion | ![todo]: Artrane keeps a lot of control over Raphoe, including its religion (halfling religion)

### Navan ![grandf]
Navan is an impenetrable fortress, home to most of Nexion's hobgoblins. The city itself is Spartan with few to no decorations, parks, gardens or the likes. Even the palace of the ruling chieftain is built in undecorated sandstone. A few sculptures of war heroes stand on the large, open squares. Each neighborhood has its own barracks with permanent garrison.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~5,000 inhabitants
 Government | **Militocracy:** Navan's primary chieftain rules with an iron fist. The whole society is warped around the defense and strength of the fortress.
 Majority | ![hobgob] (pretty much all people)
 Minorities | ![kenku] (government-licensed spies), ![stout] (a few resident traders)
 Crime rates | Perfectly safe: the army keeps track of everything and justice is swift and irreversible.
 Religion | ![todo]: only the hobgoblins' religion is allowed

### Hammore ![grandf]
Hammore, the silent city. Hammore is a kenku monastery focused on actual silence. Only the matriarchs are allowed to "talk" (insofar as kenku can talk) in the Oval Room, where they make the decisions. Throughout the years, some families have settled around the monastery, however, Hammore itself ends at the walls of the monastery, but the matriarchs' rule extends over surrounding settlement as well.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~750 inhabitants
 Government | **Matriarchy:** the matriarch of a the great families which compose of over 80% of the monastery's population rule Hammore.
 Majority | ![kenku] (mostly monks)
 Minorities | ![silver], ![hobgob] (monks)
 Crime rates | Inside of the monastery, there is no crime. The surrounding settlement has a little bit of criminals
 Religion | ![todo]: only the kenku religion is allowed; all others aren't allowed within the walls of the monastery

### Fool's Gold ![gold]
Not a true city, Fool's Gold is the largest "settlement" on the Gold Shores. There is no law, no rules, nothing. Government is an illusion. But that doesn't mean there's no justice: people take justice in their own hands, which means the few trees are the stage for many hangings.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~850 inhabitants
 Government | **Kleptocracy/Anarchy:** there is no real government in Fool's Gold: everyone does their own bidding.
 Majority | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities: ![human] ![hill] ![kenku] ![bronze] ![kobold] - all mostly scoundrels and low-life criminals
 Minorities | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities
 Crime rates | Very, very high
 Religion | Any and none: there aren't signs of any religion, but there are no rules against any either.

### Arris ![des_ancients]
A desert city made entirely out of sandstone, Arris is a marvel. Contrarily to most desert cities, Arris welcomes visitors. The arches and spires of the city make it one of the most beautiful cities in Nexion. Angel's Tears, the nearby lake, is entirely integrated in the design of the city, fueling many fountains and streams in the city. Gardens are omnipresent, making Arris a welcome change after the miles of dry desert.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,000 inhabitants
 Government | **Autocracy:** an ancient line of red dragonborn rule Arris.
 Majority | ![kobold] (most citizens)
 Minorities | ![red] (the higher bureaucratic functions), ![kenku] (entertainers), ![stout] (traders)
 Crime rates | Low: the desert allows for harsh and swift judgements
 Religion | ![todo] (some religions)

### Remicj ![des_ancients]
Remicj is a coastal city offering to the outside world the miracles of Arris. The city is built in districts, separated by long roads and large, open squares. The districts themselves are built in the side of the hills, protecting the people from the harsh, merciless sun on the Desert of the Ancients. The districts themselves are mostly the giant villas of the wealthy merchants and their storehouses. A few districts are for the halfling artificers. Near the docks, large storehouses shield the low taverns from the sun. Each of the huge squares is decorated with a lot of beautiful statues in the most exquisite materials. Urban legend has it that there are always tabaxi in Remicj, but that you can never encounter the same tabaxi twice, as they're always passing by.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,500 inhabitants, of which ~850 permanently
 Government | **Plutocracy:** the wealthy merchants and traders of Remicj lay down their own laws, protected by their private armies.

 Minorities | ![human] (sailors), ![kenku] (scoundrels, bartenders), ![tabaxi] (passing traders), ![stout] (traders, artificers)
 Crime rates | High near the docks, relatively low elsewhere
 Religion | ![todo] (hobgoblin religion) is most prevailing, but others are allowed as well

### Mondou ![des_ancients]
Pressed on the edge of the continent, Mondou is a safe haven for exiles and similar low-life scum. Apart from The Slums and the Gold Shores, Mondou has the largest criminal population on Nexion. Contrasting to the expectations, crime rates in Mondou are low. The city consists small houses built inside a huge cavern and connected by small alleys. A small fishing port keeps the city alive while irrigation is used in the lower levels of the cave to grow vegetables and herbs. The wild fennec are holy animals and shouldn't ever be injured or hunted.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | Unknown
 Government | **Dictatorship:** when the original founder of the city died, he appointed a friend as next dictator. That tradition has been held high for as long as Mondou exists.
 Majority | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities: ![kenku] ![tabaxi] ![half-orc] ![orc] ![goblin] ![goliath] ![hobgob] ![bugbear] (artificers, builders, fishermen, farmers)
 Minorities | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities
 Crime rates | Extremely low
 Religion | All religions are allowed and accepted, but official religions don't want to be associated with Mondou

## Island of Promise
### The Slums ![free_h]
The most upstream part of the buildings along the Rufil, The Slums is a network of small, curving alleys. The place is teeming with crime and other similar activities.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | Unknown
 Government | *Theoretically:* **Democracy:** A group of representatives, elected from among all people on the Island of Promise, rules the whole island. *Practically:* **Anarchy:** since no law enforcers dare enter The Slums, it's an area left to its own devices.
 Majority | ![half-orc] (mob members)
 Minorities | ![kenku], ![tiefling], ![bugbear], ![goblin] (all scoundrels)
 Crime rates | Extremely high
 Religion | Most mob members are religious, but most religions tend to keep away from The Slums

### The Docks ![corn]
Where the Rufil streams into the Southern Sea, that's where you can find almost anything. The Docks is the most downstream part of the buildings around the Rufil. The "city" is divided into two parts: the port, around the harbor, is known for its multicultural, cheap taverns and crimes; and the upper part of The Docks, where the wealthy merchants live. Temples are prominent, shrines are found all around the harbor. The upper part has a lot of beautiful gardens and artful statues of ancestors of the wealthy families.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | Unknown
 Government | *Theoretically:* **Democracy:** A group of representatives, elected from among all people on the Island of Promise, rules the whole island. *Practically:* **Plutocracy:** the wealthy merchants living in the upper part of The Docks enforce their own laws with their private armies.

 Crime rates | Quite high near the port itself, low in the upper part of the city
 Religion | Many small temples along the river and the harbor, especially devoted to ![todo] (sea god/goddess)

### Sanctuary ![corn]
The clue is in the name: Sanctuary is a safe haven for all people. Many refugees and outcasts have found a second home in Sanctuary. As such, there is no real uniformity between the buildings: each is built in the typical style of the original tribe or city the family came from.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~3,000 inhabitants
 Government | **Democracy:** Sanctuary falls under the democratically elected government of the Island of Promise.
 Majority | ![tiefling] (traders, government officials)
 Minorities | As Sanctuary is a safe haven for everyone, most peoples who can live in the moderate climates can be found in Sanctuary
 Crime rates | Quite low due to the communal vibe in Sanctuary
 Religion | Sanctuary is really tolerant, so most (if not all) religions have their temples and shrines

## The Old World
### Hollowcliff ![northern]
Most of Hollowcliff, the northernmost port on Nexion, was carved into one of the cliffs or consists of artificially enlarged grottoes. The city lives from trade: it controls the coastal road. Most of the city houses are carved from huge large stone blocks. Impressive statues decorate the large squares and broad roads.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---

### Aurora ![northern]
Located at the mouth of the Irorood, Aurora is a trader's town. Notorious for their trade in labradorite, most of Aurora's sculptures are made from the iridescent material, making them glow in sync with the aurora above. Even though Aurora lies on the coast, it has no harbor: the Ice Ocean north of the city is frozen solid. Instead of relying on ships, Aurora's trade goes via sledges over the Ice Ocean for a large distance.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | 2,500 inhabitants
 Government | **Autocracy:** the dragonborn family (the *Rasseth*) who started the mining operations of labradorite have always ruled over Aurora.

 Crime rates | Low: dragonborn law has very little patience with criminals
 Religion | As the *Rasseth* practice a less strict version of ![todo] (dragonborn religion), other religions are welcome and present in Aurora

### Faymere ![northern]
Located on a crossroads between the Frozen Peaks, The Northern Hills, Pine's Range and the Overgrowth, Faymere is a blend of cultures and communities. Trade routes reach out to the world in all directions, along the Irorood and the Emerald Stream, but also deep into the Pine's Range and Frozen Peaks. It is said that if you can't find it in Faymere, you can't find it on The Old World at all.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Government | **Monarchy/Technocracy:** Faymere has traditionally been ruled by a monarch, with highly specialized and capable advisors, making it a strong city.
 Majority | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities: ![lightfoot], ![stout] (traders, artificers), ![human] (farmers, loggers), ![mountain], ![hill] (miners), ![tiefling] (bartenders, traders), ![yuan] (traders, priests)
 Minorities | No true, noticeable minorities or majorities
 Crime rates | Medium: in any blend of cultures, there will be some non-adaptive elements causing trouble
 Religion | Being a truly multicultural city, Faymere tolerates any and all religions

### Liberty ![arrival]
Once a tolerant city of freedom, Liberty has fallen from its lofty status. The bureaucracy strangles the city and its inhabitants. Due to the many, many layers and committees, nothing moves forward in Liberty. Many public infrastructures are dilapidated and falling apart. No-one does something to repair them, because the correct forms aren't signed by the correct people.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~7,500 inhabitants
 Government | **Bureaucracy:** an army of officials, clerks and committees rules over Liberty and the surrounding plains.
 Majority | ![human] (officials, clerks)
 Minorities | ![lightfoot] (farmers), ![stout] (artificers), ![tiefling] (officials, bartenders), ![bugbear] (very cheap workforces, slaves)
 Crime rates | Mediocre: most people are lawful, but riots break out regularly among the bugbear
 Religion | In Liberty's heyday, all religions had a place in the city. However, most temples are a bit dilapidated.

### Pyi ![arrival]
Pyi is largely built on the Prophet's Lake, allowing the hydrophile lizardfolk to go into the water at any time. Apart from the lizardfolk and their bugbear slaves, most other people are there only temporarily: Pyi is a trading hub. Most of the traders are happy to leave the stinking, slimy city behind.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,250 inhabitants at any time, of which ~450 permanently
 Government | **Meritocracy:** the smartest and most educated lizardfolk rule over Pyi.
 Majority | ![lizard] (most inhabitants)
 Minorities | ![bugbear] (slaves)
 Crime rates | Very high, mostly caused by bugbear
 Religion | ![todo]: only the lizardfolk religion is allowed in public

### Prophethome ![arrival]
According to legend, Prophethome was the home to the prophet who walked the surface of the neighboring lake. The city itself used to be but a small yuan-ti town, but its legendary status made people from everywhere flow in. Nowadays, it's an unwelcoming, cold city. Crime rates have soared so much that most traders prefer to stay in Pyi.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~750 inhabitants, and declining
 Government | **Confederacy:** Prophethome and a large part of the surrounding plains are ruled by the *Confederacy of Religious Interests* (CRI). However, the *CRI* is way past its heyday and is losing power over its members.

 Crime rates | High, and rising
 Religion | ![todo] (religion of the prophet), but shrines to all kinds of gods and spirits are omnipresent

### Highcastle ![frozen]
Highcastle is a hub for trade in the Frozen Peaks. It guards the one pass that goes through the mountains and it has access to the sources for most major rivers sprouting there. Most of Highcastle is built in caves or on terraces carved into the mountains by magic. High bridges connect various parts of the city and magical automata make transport up and down more easy. The higher up the mountain one lives, the higher their family is in status. Very little sunlight reaches the lowest levels of the city. Most carts approach the city on a long, high bridge that arches down to passes between the mountains, allowing the traders to dodge the more dangerous parts of the city.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~2,500 inhabitants
 Government | **Hierarchy:** Highcastle is (largely) ruled by consensus, but not all are equal: the higher you live in the city, the more your votes weigh through. In times of crisis, a single supreme ruler is chosen among the most influential people for a short timespan.
 Majority | ![white] (high-class citizens, wealthy merchants)
 Minorities | ![kenku] (low-class thugs and guards), ![tiefling] (low-class mages, frauds and bartenders), ![goliath] (scholars, resident traders, guards)
 Crime rates | The lower you get into the city, the higher the crime rates
 Religion | Religion is frowned upon, but low in the city, there are a few shrines

### Peinsheim ![pine]

 Crime rates | Low, sometimes small brawls among exiled firbolg
 Religion | Shrines to all kinds of gods and spirits

### Xocali ![overgr]
Xocali is the main yuan-ti city: a grand, splendid complex of beautiful homes, artfully crafted statues and high temples, it's a sight for sore eyes. The city is meticulously planned and follows complex geometric patterns. Life in Xocali is complex as well, with lots of layers in the society and lots of rules for all kinds of encounters. Strangers (including people who once lived in Xocali but moved away) are only allowed in the outer parts of the city. Rumors go an actual anathema lives in the biggest temple of all.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---

 Majority | ![yuan] (all across the society)
 Minorities | ![lizard] (cheap workforces, construction), ![silver] (scholars, mages)
 Crime rates | Extemely low
 Religion | ![todo] (yuan-ti religion), all others are forbidden

### Tyanhuar ![overgr]
Located in a part of the Overgrowth where the vegetation is less dense due to some small hills, Tyanhuar is a trade hub connecting Pyi and Obsidiana to Xocali and the north. Tyanhuar's architecture combines the obsidian and rough stones from the Lava Foothills with the slender, wood-based structures common to the Overgrowth.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---

 Crime rates | Medium: the rich traders and wealthy merchants attract all kinds of scoundrels
 Religion | Most religions have their spaces in Tyanhuar; including some magnificent yuan-ti temples

### Obsidiana ![lava]
Surrounded by volcanoes and canyons, life in Obsidiana is a constant struggle for survival. The city itself is mostly built from obsidian, basalt and similar volcanic materials, giving it a dark look. As one of the few cities supplying Nexion with obsidian, it's a very popular trading spot. The city consists of two large areas: the downs, along the Stream of Traitors, are the cheap area. More uphill (and connected by both stairways and magical automata), are is Obsidiana proper, with the homes of the rich merchants and the miners themselves.

 Minorities | ![human] (traders), ![hill] (miners), ![half-orc] (miners, farmers), ![kenku] (ship repairs, bartenders, traders)

### Ulthar ![storm_des]
Ulthar is the only city where sedentary tabaxi live: most other tabaxi roam the Storm Desert, the Lava Foothills and the Desert of the Ancients. Ulthar boasts an unparalleled university for mages. Most of Ulthar's mages are the local tabaxi, which are often employed by the city as defense forces after graduating. The city itself forms a stark contrast with the surrounding desert: lush, exotic gardens, lots of fountains, ...

### Castleport ![anly]
By far the largest city on Nexion, Castleport also is the richest, providing a home to most of the wealthy traders, merchants and land owners. The illustrious group of merchants called the *Negosy* rule the city, while their private armies keep the order. It's one of the fairest cities on Nexion with most everyone having equal chances. Even though the city is huge, crime rates are minimal with only the harbor being used for smuggling and other low-life activities. The city is always teeming with life. Scattered between the houses and stores are large, lush gardens tended by a veritable army of gardeners. Statues of the founding *Negosy* members are positioned all through the city.

### Artrane ![anly]
Like all cities along the Anly, Artrane is a rich city. It has a colony (or a satrapy) called Raphoe, in the Holy Lands. It's the only city with a colony left. The city centre still consists of the small, halfling-sized homes, but the farther you stray from the central halls (which are actually very large), the more human-sized the buildings become. Even though Artrane is ruled by its own patriarchal government, the influence of the *Negosy* is not undeniable.
