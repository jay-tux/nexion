### Ulthar ![storm_des]
Ulthar is the only city where sedentary tabaxi live: most other tabaxi roam the Storm Desert, the Lava Foothills and the Desert of the Ancients. Ulthar boasts an unparalleled university for mages. Most of Ulthar's mages are the local tabaxi, which are often employed by the city as defense forces after graduating. The city itself forms a stark contrast with the surrounding desert: lush, exotic gardens, lots of fountains, ...  
Ulthar is probably the only city where religion and extralegal factions are forbidden.

 Quick overview | <i></i>
 --- | ---
 Size | ~1,250 inhabitants
 Government | **Autocracy:** an ancient family of Tabaxi, tracing their origins back before the [Arrival](./world-hist.md#arrival), rules Ulthar.
 Defense | The surrounding desert is Ulthar's main line of defense. The secondary line are Ulthar's renowned mages.
 Majority | ![tabaxi] (mages, scholars, traders, adventurers)
 Minorities | ![stout] (artificers), ![tiefling] (sholars, bartenders), ![kenku] (low-life scoundrels)
 Crime rates | Only kenku scoundrels, mages keep most everything in check

### Castleport ![anly]
By far the largest city on Nexion, Castleport also is the richest, providing a home to most of the wealthy traders, merchants and land owners. The illustrious group of merchants called the *Negosy* rule the city, while their private armies keep the order. It's one of the fairest cities on Nexion with most everyone having equal chances. Even though the city is huge, crime rates are minimal with only the harbor being used for smuggling and other low-life activities. The city is always teeming with life. Scattered between the houses and stores are large, lush gardens tended by a veritable army of gardeners. Statues of the founding *Negosy* members are positioned all through the city.  
Most, if not all, religions and factions have at least one base in Castleport.
