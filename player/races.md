## Player's Handbook Races
*For all races in this section goes ![phb].*  
#### Dwarf
![hill] ![mountain]

 Subrace | Location(s)
 --- | ---
 Hill Dwarf | ![h_ice] ![grandf] ![gold] ![free_h] ![northern] ![lava]
 Mountain Dwarf | ![v_heaven] ![frozen]

Mountain dwarfs on Nexion are haughty, wealthy and very religious. They tend to look down on their cousins, the hill dwarfs. Hill dwarfs, on the other side, are more down-to-earth and submissive. They're devout and hard-working.  
Long ago, the mountain dwarfs used to oppress the hill dwarfs. That is, until the legendary hill dwarf leader Byron Hammerhead started a bloody revolution against the mountain dwarfs, who were taken by surprise. As a result, the mountain dwarfs were driven out of the hilly territories the hill dwarfs occupy until now. However, both sides live in peace now: after a few centuries of skirmishes here and there, the mountain dwarf king Horald the Merciful offered his apologies to the hill dwarfs, who accepted gracefully.

#### Elf
There are no elves on Nexion, see the [world history](./world-hist.md).  

#### Halfling
![lightfoot] ![stout]

 Subrace | Location(s)
 --- | ---
 Lightfoot Halfling | ![grandf] ![free_h] ![corn] ![arrival] ![pine] ![overgr] ![anly]
 Stout Halfling | ![grandf] ![des_ancients] ![northern] ![arrival] ![storm_des] ![anly]

 As everywhere else, halflings on Nexion are light-hearted, happy-go-lucky people. They tend to get along with everyone because of their merry nature. According to legends, they used to be jesters on the [Forgotten World](./world-hist.md#forgotten-world). Now they live scattered and are usually found in happy communities with many inter-communal ties. Their happy-go-lucky mood makes them also a bit careless, so they tend to lose little things and trinkets everywhere.

#### Human
![human]

 Location(s) | ![gold] ![free_h] ![corn] ![northern] ![arrival] ![pine] ![overgr] ![swamp] ![lava] ![storm_des] ![anly]
 --- | ---

Before the [Arrival](./world-hist.md#arrival), humans used to be second-class citizens: not having the other races' abilities, they were usually oppressed or ignored. However, during the colonization of Nexion, many other races have learnt to accept and live in peace with humans. Now, they usually keep to [The Old World](./world_fow.md#the-old-world). A few gold-diggers have tried their luck on the [![gold]][gold_l]. When they live in big cities, surrounded by other races, humans tend to be accepting and welcoming. However, when they live in secluded communities, they tend to be very traditional and xenophobic.

#### Half-Elf
There are no half-elves on Nexion.  

#### Dragonborn
![black] ![blue] ![brass] ![copper] ![gold] ![green] ![red] ![silver] ![white]

 Subrace | Location(s) | Typical Trait
 --- | --- | ---
 Black Draconic Ancestry | ![swamp] | Backwater, a bit less intelligent
 Blue Draconic Ancestry | ![h_ice] | Foolhardy and stubborn
 Brass Draconic Ancestry | ![arrival] ![storm_des] | Curious and studious
 Bronze Draconic Ancestry | ![gold] | Materialistic and a bit egoistical
 Copper Draconic Ancestry | ![free_h] ![anly] | Joyful and sometimes a bit childish
 Gold Draconic Ancestry | ![v_heaven] | Haughty; some tend to have a god complex
 Green Draconic Ancestry | ![pine] | Traditional and naturalistic
 Red Draconic Ancestry | ![des_ancients] ![lava] | Honest and bold, sometimes short-tempered
 Silver Draconic Ancestry | ![grandf] ![overgr] | Wise and sometimes cynical
 White Draconic Ancestry | ![northern] ![frozen] | Solitary and independent

Dragonborn are found everywhere, but they are still quite rare: they live in small, scattered communities, usually together with kobolds (as friends and neighbors, never as pets or slaves). They have good ties with local firbolg (if any), and Yuan-ti. It is said that when a kobold and a dragonborn are born on the same day, they'll be friends for life. They all have their own defining trait, which is listed in the table above.

#### Gnome
![forest] ![rock]

 Subrace | Location(s)
 --- | ---
 Forest Gnome | ![corn] ![pine] ![overgr] ![swamp]
 Rock Gnome | ![h_ice] ![free_h] ![northern] ![pine]

Gnomes are rarely seen: they tend to keep to themselves and usually don't interact much with the rest of the world, except for local halflings. Their trinkets are found in (halfling) shops all over the world and are usually heavy-priced. What non-gnomes know about gnomes are usually the rumors they heard via-via from halflings. According to the rumors, they are mechanical geniuses who can make any device, but they're also the stealthiest of thieves (even though this could be because halflings tend to be messy and lose things everywhere).

#### Half-Orc
![half-orc]

 Location(s) | ![free_h] ![corn] ![swamp] ![lava]
 --- | ---

Half-orcs on Nexion tend to be seen as degenerate, second-class citizens. However, when they prove themselves as strong, good, faithful citizens, they can be admired for their abilities as well. The only groups they can never get along with are humans and orcs: both groups see them as traitors and half-castes.

#### Tiefling
![tiefling]

 Location(s) | ![free_h] ![corn] ![northern] ![arrival] ![frozen] ![pine] ![overgr] ![swamp] ![lava] ![storm_des] ![anly]
 --- | ---

Tieflings don't have the connection to the devil they have on other worlds. Just like humans, the weren't really accepted on [The Forgotten World](./world-hist.md#the-forgotten-world), however they've proven themselves strong and independent, but also caring and nice during the colonization of Nexion. Right now, they are accepted everywhere and welcome as friends. However, when visiting the [Holy Lands](./world_fow.md#holy-lands) they are sometimes still regarded with ill-ease.

## Volo's Guide to Monsters Races
*For all races in this section goes ![volo].*
### Exotic Races
*In ![volo], these races are described as rather rare and exotic. However, most of these are a common sight in their respective "territories", except where noted differently.*  
#### Firbolg
![firbolg]

 Location(s) | ![h_ice] ![pine] ![overgr] ![anly]
 --- | ---

Firbolg are solitary and rather shamanistic. They keep to themselves but won't turn away a guest when one arrives in need. They're known for their great healing skills and their beautiful gardens. When living in the same area as local dragonborn and halflings, they tend to be more open to those groups. What people know about them are usually rumors heard from halflings. When a firbolg does an unforgivable deed in their home community, they are exiled (from all firbolg tribes) and tend to wander the forests of the world, tending to the nature around them. Sometimes they redeem themselves and find a second home in another community.

#### Goliath
![goliath]

 Location(s) | ![v_heaven] ![northern] ![frozen]
 --- | ---

 Goliath are the stubborn, proud, and competitive giants they usually are on other worlds as well. Everything is a competition to them and even their guests need to participate in local competitions. Their spirit and competitive drive are feared throughout the world cause they usually choose competitions where they can win. When living in the [![v_heaven]][v_heaven_l], they tend to be haughty to outsiders. Legend has it that their stubborn and proud nature caused them to clash with the oppressor on [The Forgotten World](./world-hist.md#the-forgotten-world). During the colonization of Nexion, the goliath usually roamed about on their own, partially due to being feared by the others and alienated from them.

#### Kenku
![kenku]

 Location(s) | ![grandf] ![gold] ![des_ancients] ![free_h] ![corn] ![arrival] ![overgr] ![swamp] ![lava] ![storm_des]
 --- | ---

The kenku are typical city-folk: they are found almost exclusively in cities. They are usually thugs and other low-life people, tending to criminality. However, they often have ties to the most important people, knowing them "professionally" and sometimes even able to bribe the rich. They're usually not trusted by the rich, they're kind of ignored by most people and they're seen as "our kind of guys" by the poor. Some have taken up a Robin Hood lifestyle: living just outside of the city, stealing from the rich and the traders in the city, ambushing tourists and giving to the poor.

#### Lizardfolk
![lizard]

 Location(s) | ![overgr] ![swamp] ![anly]
 --- | ---

Lizardfolk are cold, calculated and emotionless. However, they tend to have be intelligent and self-sufficient. They seem Backwater to most others but they actually live in a highly structured society with many complex interactions. Beneath their simple homes in the swamps, forests and boughs of [The Old World](./world_fow.md#the-old-world) lie hidden tunnels and complex systems. They tend to possess quite advanced technology, well-hidden behind a facade of degeneration. They hide their achievements because if those were to become common knowledge instead of the rumors they are now, the lizardfolk might be attacked by others, and they know.

#### Tabaxi
![tabaxi]

 Location(s) | ![des_ancients] ![lava] ![storm_des]
 --- | ---

Tabaxi on Nexion are carefree wanderers, living for adventure and occupying the most dangerous of environments: deserts and volcanic territory. When they stop their mobile houses, they are known to be great at partying, telling stories and living life to the fullest. However, contrarily to orcs, they tend to keep an eye out for danger as well. Tabaxi are one of the races native to the world, along with the tritons, goblins, kobolds and bugbears. However, before the [Arrival](./world-hist.md#arrival), they lived about everywhere. Some of the other races have hunted them down and slaughtered them mercilessly, forcing the few remaining tabaxi to flee into those dangerous areas. There are rumors of tabaxi assassins hunting down prominent leaders of other races, but they're mostly regarded as a legend and aren't taken seriously.

#### Triton
![triton]

 Location(s) | ![central] ![raven] ![romb] ![verdant]
 --- | ---

The elusive, xenophobic tritons were one of the native races. Before the [Arrival](./world-hist.md#arrival), they used to live in coastal towns as well as deep-sea dwellings. However, when they heard rumors of slaughter by unknown forces from the tabaxi, they quickly burnt down and abandoned their coastal towns. When a triton is spotted by another race, they are the subject of cautious curiosity. Tritons are accepted but not really integrated nor trusted.

### Monstrous Races
*In ![volo], these races are described as wild and monstrous. However, some of these races are actually integrated and common as humans on Nexion.*
#### Bugbear
![bugbear]

 Location(s) | ![grandf] ![free_h] ![corn] ![arrival]
 --- | ---

 Bugbears are the lowest of the lowest: hunted down by the firbolgs, enslaved by humans, dwarfs, tieflings, goliath and hobgoblins. They are rarely, if ever, free and their own master. Even the free ones are never really trusted and are assumed to be slaves. Only the half-orcs tend to accept them into their communities as equals.

#### Goblin
![goblin]

 Location(s) | ![free_h] ![corn] ![overgr]
 --- | ---

Goblins were hunted down, just like bugbears, when the other races arrived on Nexion. Few goblins are left from that time. When they live on the [Island of Promise](./world_fow.md#island-of-promise), they are small-scale farmers and harvesters, only there they are treated like true people. In the [![overgr]][overgr_l], they live hidden in small, underground boughs and caves, hidden from the other races who would hunt them down. The other races of the [![overgr]][overgr_l] see them as pests, and not without reason: they tend to be kleptomaniacs.

#### Hobgoblin
![hobgob]

 Location(s) | ![grandf] ![des_ancients] ![free_h] ![corn] ![northern]
 --- | ---

Hobgoblins are noble warrios, skilled in the martial arts and masters with their curved blades. They live in a strict society with many rules. They treat everyone as equals. Their towns and fortresses are elegant yet sturdy and strong. Their honor is their highest good, and those who are dishonoring others or their guests are usually exiled without mercy. They are hospitable, but not open to others integrating in their societies. Others know them for their virtues.

#### Kobold
![kobold]

 Location(s) | ![h_ice] ![v_heaven] ![grandf] ![gold] ![des_ancients] ![free_h] ![corn] ![northern] ![arrival] ![frozen] ![pine] ![overgr] ![swamp] ![lava] ![storm_des] ![anly]
 --- | ---

Of all the native races, the kobolds have survived the [Arrival](./world-hist.md#arrival) the best: they are the trusty companions and friends of the dragonborn, with whom they live. When a kobold and a dragonborn are born on the same day, they are friends for life. They are especially good friends with halflings and tieflings as well, strengthening the diplomatic relationships between those races and the dragonborn. They have a happy-go-lucky attitude and are usually cheerful, which is in stark contrast with their usually more grim and serious companions.

#### Orc
![orc]

 Location(s) | ![h_ice] ![v_heaven] ![northern] ![pine]
 --- | ---

 The orcs were never truly part of the other races, not even on [The Old World](./worold-hist.md#the-old-world); legend has it that all orcs stem from one warband attempting to attack the other races (and the oppressor) at the moment of the [Ejection](./world-hist.md#ejection). They are expert fortifiers and live in cold, Spartan quarters in their fortresses. Orc society knows two sides: the fortifiers and farmers keeping the warbands alive, and the pillaging troops. Most, if not all, orcs are prone to substance abuse, which means their pillagers rarely return home: they don't guard their camps because most are drunk by that time.

#### Yuan-ti
![yuan]

 Location(s) | ![arrival] ![overgr] ![swamp]
 --- | ---

The cult-like yuan-ti are seen as freaks by most others, but the purebloods are accepted in other societies as well, even tho no-one is really at ease with one of them in the same room. Of all the non-native races, they're the only ones to know the tritons and lizardfolk well. They live in large, lush, green cities with beautiful, huge homes and exquisite statues. The center of most cities is a huge pyramid. They are known for their excellent artistic prowess.
