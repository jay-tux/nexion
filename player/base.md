## Starting Conditions
As you've gotten a training and done some missions, you're quite versed in adventuring already. As such, you start your adventure as a *level 5* character, instead of *level 1* (see ![phb] for more details on levels). Before leaving for [Liberty](./world_fow_cities.md#liberty), your local [Overseer](./factions.md#pioneers-delight) gave you `300 + 1d8 x 10 gp`. You also got some equipment on you, namely your *starting equipment* and one other piece of equipment based on your specialization:
